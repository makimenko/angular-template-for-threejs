## [[0.1.0] - 2019-04-18](https://github.com/makimenko/angular-template-for-threejs/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
Same as [0.0.3], see [0.0.3] for the reasons it was yanked.

## [0.0.3] - 2019-04-18 [YANKED]
Yanked due to patch version increase not adhering to semver. Also, due to the tag `v0.0.3` already having been used for [0.0.2], which is confusing. From now on, `atft` library versions will match Git tags and GitHub releases.
