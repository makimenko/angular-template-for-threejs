simple components:\nExample :\n  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \nStorybook\nExplore provided Angular components in isolation!\nClick below to see the demo in a web browser:\n\n\n\nGoals of this repo\n\nImplement npm atft library\nBindings for Three.js\nSceneComponent with basic usage of scene, camera, lights, helpers, renderer\nIntegrated Three.js examples as components (e.g. OrbitControls, OBJLoader, ObjectLoader)\n\n\nDevelop and test library components in isolation via Storybook\n\nUsage in your Angular project\n\nSet up an Angular project and install dependencies:\nExample :npm i three dagre atft yaml --save\nnpm i @types/dagre @types/three --save-dev\nImport library into your module:\nExample :import { AtftModule } from 'atft';\n...\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    AtftModule\n  ]\n ...\nUse atft library components in src/app.component.html:\nExample :\n  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n(optionally) if you want to fit 3D scene canvas into entire screen (horizontally and vertically):\nin src/styles.css:\nExample : html, body {\n     height: 100%;\n     margin: 0;\n }  in src/app/app.component.css:\nExample : :host {\n     height: 100%;\n     display: flex;\n } \n\nUsed by\nSample vect project, which is based on atft library:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment\nBuild Library\n\ngit clone https://github.com/makimenko/angular-template-for-threejs.git\nnpm install\nng build atft\n\nRun Tests\n\nnpm test\n\nRun Storybook\nRun and watch locally: npm run storybook\nOur storybook config is in ./storybook and our stories in ./src/stories.\nSee the official Storybook.js documentation for more information.\nAPI Documentation\nFor mode details see API documentation\nRelease and Changelog\n\nFollow Conventional Commits.\nSee standard-version guidelines for release and changelog update.\n\nTo automatically generate changelog and bump atft version:\nExample :npm run
